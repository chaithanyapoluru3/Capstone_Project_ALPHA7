# Introduction
In embedded systems, communication between devices is crucial for data transfer, synchronization, and control. This project focuses on three widely-used communication protocols: CAN (Controller Area Network), I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). 
                           CAN is designed for real-time data transfer in noisy environments, widely employed in automotive and industrial systems. I2C, a simple two-wire protocol, facilitates low-speed communication between a master and multiple slave devices, making it ideal for embedded systems like sensors and displays. SPI, a high-speed full-duplex protocol, is used for efficient, low-latency communication between a master and peripherals like memory devices and sensors. 
                         Together, these protocols form the backbone of communication in modern embedded systems, enabling seamless data exchange across various applications.


# Overview of the problem statement
  The increasing complexity of embedded systems in fields like automotive, industrial automation, and consumer electronics demands reliable, efficient, and real-time communication between multiple devices. Systems require communication protocols that can handle various data transmission needs, from high-speed, low-latency operations to robust, fault-tolerant interactions in noisy environments.

                         This project addresses the challenge of designing, simulating, and validating three key communication protocols—CAN, I2C, and SPI—using Verilog. Each protocol has its own strengths and specific use cases, but integrating and understanding their functionality through simulations provides crucial insights into their behavior and performance in real world applications.

# Methodology
                                     The methodology involves designing the CAN, I2C, and SPI protocols in Verilog, followed by extensive simulations to validate their functionality and performance through waveform analysis.

## I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit)
I2C stands for Inter-Integrated Circuit. It is a bus interface connection protocol incorporated into devices for serial communication. It was originally designed by Philips Semiconductor in 1982. Recently, it is a widely used protocol for short-distance communication. It is also known as Two Wired Interface (TWI).
