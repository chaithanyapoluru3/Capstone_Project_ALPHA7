## â€¢	CAN Protocol Waveforms:

<br> **Message Framing** : The waveforms show clear delineation of message start and end bits, confirming proper message framing. This indicates that the protocol can effectively delineate messages in a multi-node environment.
<br> **Error Detection** : The error detection waveforms illustrate that any corrupted messages were flagged correctly, showcasing the robustness of the CAN protocol in maintaining data integrity.
