## I2C Protocol Waveforms:
 
<br> **Data Transmission** : The waveforms reveal successful clock (SCL) and data (SDA) signal synchronization, confirming that the master-slave communication operates as intended. The clear transitions in the SDA line during data transfer indicate that the protocol can handle multiple devices on the same bus effectively.
 <br> **Start and Stop Conditions** : The presence of distinct start and stop conditions in the waveforms validates the protocol's capability to initiate and terminate communication sessions accurately.
 <br> **Address Recognition**: The waveform analysis shows successful address recognition by the slave devices, confirming that the protocol can efficiently manage multiple slaves on the bus.
