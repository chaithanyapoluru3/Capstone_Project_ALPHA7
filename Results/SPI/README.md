## â€¢	SPI Protocol Waveforms:

<br> **Clock Synchronization** : The waveforms demonstrate correct synchronization between the master and slave devices, with clear clock signals leading data transfers. This indicates that SPI can achieve high-speed communication reliably.
<br> **Data Integrity** : The received data waveform matches the transmitted data, confirming that the SPI protocol maintains high data integrity during transfer, essential for applications requiring low latency and fast communication.
